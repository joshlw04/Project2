# Just Thought You Should Know… 

React project for WDI

##Project MVP
	>An app with the ability to accept posts with a recipient and a complaint. The post will be pushed onto a ‘complaint board’ which will be available for all users. Users will be able to edit their own complaints after posting.
	>Login: Users will be able to create an anonymous profile with a username and email. Logged in users will be the only ones able to post a complaint to the board.
	>“Agree”/“Disagree” button: logged in user will be able to “agree” with a complaint against another person. Logged out/unregistered users will not be able to “agree”.

##Technologies
	>React.js for the view layer
	>Google Firebase for database/authorization management
	>Node Package Management for dependencies/webpack for local server ability

##Next Steps
	>Making a wireframe of the UI from a mobile-first perspective
	>Mapping out components and how they should interact

	###Difficulties
		>Researching how to use Firebase for authorization and limiting certain areas of the app for logged in /logged out users
		>Mapping components and figuring out what components should have state

##Bonuses
	>Sending an anonymous email to the recipient from JTYSK outlining the situation/complaint
	>The ability for logged in users to comment on other posts
